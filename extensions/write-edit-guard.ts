/**
 * Write-vs-Edit Guard
 *
 * Intercepts `write` tool calls and blocks them if the target file already
 * exists, returning a structured reason that tells the model to use `edit`
 * instead. Implements the Write-vs-Edit invariant from the little-coder
 * paper (itayinbarr): prevents small models from silently overwriting
 * partially-working code with a whole-file rewrite during exploration.
 *
 * Also closes the common bypass where a small model, seeing the block,
 * falls back to `bash rm <path>` and then retries `write`. Paths observed
 * being deleted or moved away via bash in the current session are tracked
 * and treated as if they still existed for guard purposes.
